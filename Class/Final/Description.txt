Option 1: D&D Character Creator

Program will be a basic character creation tool for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.

Program will run through basic questions: Character Name, Player Name, Character Class, Character Race.  After getting basic information program will have user distribute points for attributes, going in order of standard character sheet: Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma.

Program will also have ability to save file as a basic .txt so user can transfer info to standard character sheet.

If possible, I want to be able to include an extra file that it can call that will include bonuses for Character Race, but I'm concerned that it will overly complicate the project.

Project Code Sample:

for attr in attributes.keys():
            while True:
                try:
                    value = int(input(f"Assign points to {attr} (Remaining: {points}): "))
                    if 0 <= value <= points:
                        attributes[attr] = value + 8
                        points -= value
                        break
                    else:
                        print("Invalid amount. You must assign within the remaining points.")
                except ValueError:
                    print("Please enter a valid number.")
