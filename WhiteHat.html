    <h1>White Hat Hackers</h1>
    <p>White Hat Hackers are hackers that are legally allowed to hack into and subvert security systems. The reasons they do this are because they are employed to  find vulerabilities in systems in an effort to improve security protocols. Places that employ these typees of hackers would include large or small businesses, government agencies, or anyone wanting to test their security systems. Efforts by these hackers are often done in circumspect ways, to include social engineering, instead of just brute force efforts.</p>
